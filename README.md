# Scheduling-in-High-Level-Synthesis-(HLS)

## Introduction

High Level Synthesis is an automated design process that takes as input an algorithmic description in order to create the digital hardware that implements the desired function. \
The following respository implements the Resource-Constrained Scheduling i.e., Given constraints on the resources, find the fastest scheduling which satisfies the constraints.
